            <strong>verse i</strong><br>
            there’s two cups<br>
            sitting on our table<br>
            sharing steam while<br>
            we are sharing dreams<br>
            over tea we discuss<br>
            the memories of us<br>
            and all that we are<br>
            excited to do next<br>
            <br>
            <strong>chorus</strong><br>
            there is so much to discover<br>
            more and more love for each other (more and more love)<br>
            i can’t wait to be with you forever<br>
            <br>
            <strong>verse ii</strong><br>
            you’re literally the epitome<br>
            of all i can see and all i want to be<br>
            would you mind be-ing the one for me<br>
            <br>
            <strong>chorus x2</strong><br>
            there is so much to discover<br>
            more and more love for each other (more and more love)<br>
            i can’t wait to be with you forever<br>
            <br>
