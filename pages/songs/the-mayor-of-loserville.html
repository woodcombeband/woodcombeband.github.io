        <h2>the mayor of loserville</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>verse i</strong><br>
            you built this town you’re destroying<br>
            the one which you claim to hate<br>
            the town in whose foundations<br>
            your name is there engraved<br>
            <br>
            <strong>verse ii</strong><br>
            the people act on your teaching<br>
            yet you claim to disagree<br>
            you come roaring, lashing, seething<br>
            when they lift up their works<br>
            <br>
            <strong>verse iii</strong><br>
            one day they won’t seek you<br>
            one day they’ll leave you alone<br>
            only then will you find your desire<br>
            for their insecure delusions<br>
            <br>
            <strong>chorus i</strong><br>
            why did you build this town?<br>
            from which you live willingly exiled<br>
            in your mansion of self righteousness<br>
            with your glass cannon temperament<br>
            <br>
            <strong>verse iv</strong><br>
            why did you build this town?<br>
            for which you feel no pride<br>
            this town has flourished<br>
            become beautiful on its own<br>
            <br>
            <strong>verse v</strong><br>
            but it’s not exactly what you want<br>
            everything’s one inch to the left<br>
            which begs the question what if<br>
            it was exactly what you wanted?<br>
            <br>
            <strong>chorus ii</strong><br>
            would you feel satisfied?<br>
            would you feel full inside?<br>
            no, because you’ve got a hole<br>
            with a vacuum at the bottom<br>
            <br>
            <strong>verse vi</strong><br>
            you’ll never be finished<br>
            you’ll always want another town<br>
            the population ever growing<br>
            and the starvation ever killing<br>
            <br>
            <strong>verse vii</strong><br>
            why did you build this town?<br>
            you have eight more before it<br>
            you did not need this town<br>
            so why did you build this town?<br>
