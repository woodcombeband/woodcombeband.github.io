            <strong>verse i</strong><br>
            i just wanna see you here in my garage<br>
            let’s play some ping pong<br>
            let’s talk about your mom<br>
            she made us lemonade last week<br>
            it left a sour taste on your teeth<br>
            you took me to wendy’s yesterday<br>
            <br>
            <strong>chorus</strong><br>
            i don’t know if i can do this anymore<br>
            you just took so long at the corner store<br>
            you said you’d be right back<br>
            but you took like an hour ‘n’ a half<br>
            i can’t believe you<br>
            <br>
            <strong>verse ii</strong><br>
            please can we just go back to wendy’s today<br>
            everything seemed better there when you were eating<br>
            and twisting your hair<br>
            i just want a 4 for 4<br>
            staring at you while i get sauce all over my face<br>
            <br>
            <strong>chorus</strong><br>
            i don’t know if i can do this anymore<br>
            you just took so long at the corner store<br>
            you said you’d be right back<br>
            but you took like an hour and a half<br>
            i can’t believe you <br>
            <br>
            <strong>tags</strong><br>
            i can't believe you<br>
            i cannont believe you<br>
            i can’t believe you<br>
            but i can’t leave you
        </p>
